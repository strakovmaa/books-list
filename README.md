# Maťkin reading list

This app showcases my own Goodreads reading list that includes books I read with their ratings and reviews as well as books I want to read. Since Goodreads doesn´t have their own public API, I downloaded data from my personal profile and created my own API to use it as a static database. Explore the demo [here](https://matkin-reading-list.vercel.app/).

## Features
- API contains 1900+ books that can be filtered by author, title, rating or whether I read it or not
- pagination
- dialog for a new rating and a review
